# Programming Exercise

Your task is to figure out how this code works.

* Come with a test input for the function.
* Trace the flow of the program with your test input **without running the code**, keeping track of all of the variables and transformations until you can determine the output.
* Keep coming up with new inputs until you're confident until you're confident that you know how the function works.
* Write a summary of what the function does.

```js
function (person, petName){
  for (dog in person.dogs){
    if (dog.name === petName){
      return dog
    }
  }
}
```

| Input | Output |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
|   {dogs: [{ name: "Clyde"}, { name: "Korra" }]}, "Clyde"  |  {name: Clyde}  | 
| {dogs: [{ name: "Clyde"}, { name: "Korra" }]}, "Korra"    |  {name: Korra}  | 
|   {dogs : [{ name: "Clyde"}, { name: "Korra" }]}, "Binx"  | undefined       | 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>What does this program do?</th>
    <td>This program takes an array and sorts through it and associates a dogs name to the names found in the array, then returns as dog. It appears that this is a "filter" function</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Rubric

* Contains a plausible collection of test cases
* Outputs are accurately derived from inputs
* Summary is plausible
